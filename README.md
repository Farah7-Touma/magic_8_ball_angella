# magic_8_ball_angella

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

- Course : The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart / Angella / Udemy
- Idea : randomise answers to questions you are asking to yourself (ex : Shall I eat   => the picture which appear randomly has the answer YES => I will go eating)
- What I've learned :
  1 - Randomising numbers in a specific field
  2 - Changing dices pictures depending on changing variables value (Left Number Dice and Right Number Dice)
